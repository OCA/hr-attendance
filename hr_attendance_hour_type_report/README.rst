This module provides a new report in hr_attendance to display the worked time of employees split in
the following categories:

* type of day (weekday, sunday, holiday)
* daytime / nighttime

The information of a day being a holiday comes from the configured public holidays from the module hr_holidays_public.

This is meant as a helper for people interacting with external payroll systems.

Configuration
=============

There is a new setting in the Attendance settings to set on the company the
hour at which the night worktime starts and ends. The default is from 10pm to
6am.

These hours are expressed in the employee's time zone.

Usage
=====

Go to Attendances -> Attendances for Payroll, you will see a list view or a pivot view of attendances with the following values:

* date (using the check in datetime, converted to the date in the employee's timezone
* date type (normal, sunday or holiday)
* daytime work duration
* nighttime work duration
* total work duration

The list view and pivot view can be exported to a spreadsheet for further processing.
