This module provides a new report in hr_attendance to display the worked time of employees split in
the following categories:

* type of day (weekday, sunday, holiday)
* daytime / nighttime

The information of a day being a holiday comes from the configured public holidays from the module hr_holidays_public.

This is meant as a helper for people interacting with external payroll systems.
