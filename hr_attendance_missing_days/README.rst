This modules generates attendances for employee with 0 minutes for working days with missing
attendances. The configured reason is set to make it easier for filtering. This can be used
to generate pseudo attendances for working days otherwise Odoo wouldn't reduce the overtime
of the employee.

#. Go to *Attendances > Configuration > Missing Days*
#. Select a reason to set for the created attendances
