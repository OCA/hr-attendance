Attendance changes will now be registered in the chatter.
This will help prevent cheating in check-in or check-out time.
List and form views also include this change information.

Use cases:

- Attendances created from kiosk or check-in/check-out screens, are created as automatic. If their check-in or check-out dates are modified by any user, attendances are checked as 'Manually changed'.
- Attendances created from form view will apply a 60 seconds tolerance between entered and real times. If this tolerance is surpassed, attendances are checked as 'Manually changed'.

Note:

- Attendances already created won't be checked automatically on installation since it could take a large amount of time. If this is wanted it will be necessary to do it manually later.
